Kent State - Intro to Database Design Project

Members: Sydney Zuelzke, Julia Pangonis, Emma Magyarics, Ikrame Rekabi

Project Description:

The purpose of this online accessory store database is to provide a location that will be able to handle the constantly changing information of products, orders, and customers. It offers a location where all the information can be stored in one place. This database will store information related to customers, individual products, availability, employees, and order information. The information can be used to effectively manage customer orders, and customer information, track product details and analyze each product's popularity. 

There is a wide range of potential users on an online store inventory database. Users include different customers and store employees including staff, managers, and more. Employees may use this database to manage orders, inventory, and customer information. Customers may benefit from this database such as the accuracy of order processing and product availability. This database would allow users to see popular products or trends from the store and make business decisions accordingly, such as price discounts.


How to Run Locally:

The user must first implement the database (databse_proj) and relations in MySql using the included SQL file (database_proj.sql). Once that database and relation have been created, the user must bring all of the site files (HTML, PHP, CSS and Images) into their htdocs folder and put them all in the same folder. Make sure the images folder is included, and the images stay within that images folder. The user will then launch the XAMPP control panel and start MySql and Apache Web Server. The user can then access the website by typing localhost/database-project/. From there, the welcom page for The Accessory Store will load, and the user can proceed to navigate the website.
